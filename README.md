# Crowdfunding_smart_contract

Crowdfunding is the use of small amounts of capital from a large number of individuals to finance a new business venture. Depending on the type of crowdfunding, investors either donate money altruistically or get rewards such as equity in the company that raised the money.

Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.

For a good overview and starting point, please check out the official [Solidity Language Portal](https://soliditylang.org).

## Background

Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts
that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer
network where nobody has special authority over the execution, and thus they allow to implement tokens of value,
ownership, voting, and other kinds of logic.

When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of
Solidity. This is because breaking changes, as well as new features and bug fixes are
introduced regularly.

## Example

A "Hello World" program in Solidity is of even less use than in other languages, but still:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

contract HelloWorld {
    function helloWorld() external pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

To get started with Solidity, you can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), which is a
browser-based IDE. Here are some example contracts:

1. [Voting](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#voting)
2. [Blind Auction](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#blind-auction)
3. [Safe remote purchase](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#safe-remote-purchase)
4. [Micropayment Channel](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#micropayment-channel)
